# RxJava: Reactive Extensions for the JVM

This library is a Java implementation of <a href="https://rx.codeplex.com">Rx Observables</a>.

Some of the goals of RxJava are:

- Stay close to other Rx implementations while adjusting naming conventions and idioms to Java
- Match contracts of Rx should be the same
- Target the JVM not a language to allow JVM-language bindings (such as [Scala](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxScala), [Groovy](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxGroovy), [Clojure](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxGroovy) and [Kotlin](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxKotlin)).
- Support Java 6+ (to include Android support)
